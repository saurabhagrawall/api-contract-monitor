# API Contract Monitor

AI-powered microservices dependency analyzer and breaking change detector for maintaining API compatibility across distributed systems.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete microservices architecture with an intelligent monitoring system that analyzes API contracts, detects breaking changes, and predicts impact across services using AI.

**Built as a portfolio project for FAANG+ internship applications.**

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system consists of two main components:

### 1. Microservices (Demo Application)
Four independent Spring Boot microservices that simulate a real-world e-commerce system:

- **User Service** (Port 8081) - User management and authentication
- **Order Service** (Port 8082) - Order processing and management
- **Product Service** (Port 8083) - Product catalog and inventory
- **Notification Service** (Port 8084) - Notification delivery system

### 2. Contract Monitor Tool (Coming Soon)
Intelligent API monitoring system that:
- Analyzes OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
- Detects breaking changes in API contracts
- Maps service dependencies
- Predicts impact radius of changes
- Provides AI-powered suggestions for backward compatibility

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Spring Boot 3.5.6** - Application framework
- **Spring Data JPA** - Database abstraction
- **PostgreSQL 15** - Relational database
- **Hibernate** - ORM
- **Lombok** - Boilerplate reduction
- **Bean Validation** - Input validation

### API & Documentation
- **Spring Web** - REST API framework
- **SpringDoc OpenAPI 3** - API documentation

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- Maven 3.9+
- Docker Desktop
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/saurabhagrawall/api-contract-monitor.git
cd api-contract-monitor
```

2. **Start a microservice (example: User Service)**
```bash
cd services/user-service

# Start PostgreSQL database
docker-compose up -d

# Run the service
mvn spring-boot:run
```

3. **Access Swagger UI**
```
http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui.html
```

### Running All Services

Each service runs on a different port with its own database:

| Service | Port | Database Port | Swagger UI |
|---------|------|---------------|------------|
| User Service | 8081 | 5432 | http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui.html |
| Order Service | 8082 | 5433 | http://localhost:8082/swagger-ui.html |
| Product Service | 8083 | 5434 | http://localhost:8083/swagger-ui.html |
| Notification Service | 8084 | 5435 | http://localhost:8084/swagger-ui.html |

## üôè Acknowledgments

This project was born from real-world experience working at Oracle and Bajaj, where I observed how developers‚Äîboth new and experienced‚Äîstruggle to understand the ripple effects of API changes across microservices. A single field removal or type change can break dependent services, leading to production incidents and regression bugs.

The goal of this project is to build an intelligent system that:
- Makes the impact of changes visible before deployment
- Reduces regression bugs caused by API incompatibilities
- Helps teams move faster with confidence
- Bridges the gap between local development and distributed system complexity

This is a problem I'm genuinely passionate about solving, and this project represents my approach to addressing it through automation and AI.
